![Financial data analysis dashboard](https://github.com/vincenzomaltese/Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard/blob/main/images/1r.jpg?raw=true)


## Project Description

This repository contains an analysis of historical stock and revenue data for Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. It uses Python libraries for data extraction and visualization to identify patterns and trends, culminating in an interactive dashboard.

This analysis was conducted as part of the **Python Project for Data Science** course from IBM.

## Project Goals

The key questions addressed in this analysis are:

* **Question 1:** Use `yfinance` to extract historical stock data.
* **Question 2:** Use webscraping to extract Tesla's revenue data.
* **Question 3:** Use `yfinance` to extract historical stock data for other companies (Amazon, AMD, GameStop).
* **Question 4:** Use webscraping to extract GameStop's revenue data.
* **Question 5:**  Plot Tesla's stock data using an interactive graph.
* **Question 6:** Plot GameStop's stock data using an interactive graph. 

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language for data analysis.
* **Pandas:**  Used for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Beautiful Soup:** Used for web scraping to extract revenue data.
* **Yfinance:** Used to extract historical stock price data.
* **Plotly:** Used to create interactive visualizations and the dashboard.


## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 yfinance plotly
